## Reporting Security Issues

Our community takes security bugs seriously.
We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security issue, please use the GitHub Security Advisory menu of the affected project (_Security > Advisories > New draft security advisory_).
Our staff will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report.

After the initial reply to your report,
the security team will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

Please report security bugs in third-party packages to the respective package maintainers.
Vulnerabilities relating to npmjs.com or the npm CLI should be submitted to the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://hackerone.com/github).
