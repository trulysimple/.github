<!--
Please outline your solution. This will likely become part of the commit message.

1. Speak about WHAT changed and WHY, not HOW. E.g.:
   - you can mention changes made to function signatures and public types, along
     with the reasoning behind them (if that's not the issue's main objective)
   - do _not_ explain the logic implemented in function bodies and unit tests,
     unless they're important or the only changes; prefer code comments instead
2. Be CONCISE, but not PRESUMED or INCOMPLETE. E.g.:
   - you can summarize changes made to documentation and auxiliary files
   - do mention changes made to configuration files, whether they can affect the
     work of other developers and how so
   - do _not_ abbreviate words, expressions, class names and the like, which may
     not be so obvious to newcomers

Thank you!
