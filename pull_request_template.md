<!--
Please give an overview of your solution. This may become part of the commit message.
Here are some tips:

1. Speak about WHAT changed and WHY, not HOW. For example:
  - you can mention changes made to function signatures and public types, along with
    the reasoning behind them (if that's not the issue's main objective)
  - you should not explain the logic implemented in function bodies or in unit tests,
    unless they are important or are the only changes; otherwise prefer code comments
2. Be CONCISE, but not PRESUMED or INCOMPLETE. For example:
  - you can summarize changes made to documentation and auxiliary files
  - you should not refrain from mentioning changes to configuration files, if and how
    they may affect the work of other developers
  - do not abbreviate words, expressions, class names and alike, that might not be so
    obvious to newcomers
