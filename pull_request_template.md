<!-- Please outline your solution, as it will likely become part of the commit message. Some tips:

1. Speak about WHAT changed and WHY, not HOW. E.g.:
   - you can mention changes made to function signatures and public types, along with your reasoning
   - do _not_ explain the logic implemented in function bodies and unit tests, unless they're
     important or are the only changes; prefer code comments instead
2. Be CONCISE, but not PRESUMED or INCOMPLETE. E.g.:
   - you can summarize changes made to documentation and auxiliary files
   - do mention changes to configuration files, whether they can affect other people's work and how
   - do _not_ abbreviate words, class names and the like, which may not be so obvious to newcomers

Thanks! And feel free to erase this comment if you wish ;) -->
