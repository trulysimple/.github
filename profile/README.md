## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

TrulySimple is an organization dedicated to writing _thoughtful_ and _meaningful_ software.

By thoughtful we mean that it should be designed with careful thought about _how_ it's going to be used.
By meaningful we mean that it should be developed while keeping in mind _why_ it's being used.
